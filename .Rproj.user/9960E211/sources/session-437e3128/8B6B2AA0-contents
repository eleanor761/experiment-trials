ALL FILES COMPARISON
filename_similarity_summary: across file comparison

word_pair_similarity_summary: compares each initial to each initial

word_similarities_initial_dimension: compares similarity within initial descritptions. see std_variability

INITIALS ANALYSIS
IMPORTED word_variability_initial: compares similarity within each initial. see std_variability

POTENTIALS ANALYSIS
For each filename, compares all pairs of descriptions within that filename
Calculates similarity scores between description pairs
Categorizes comparisons as "within_dimension" or "across_dimension"

IMPORTED potential_filename_variability_summary.csv - Statistics showing which videos have the most variable descriptions

IMPORTED potential_dimension_pair_similarity_summary.csv - How similar descriptions are for each pair of dimensions

within_filename_description_similarities.csv - All pairwise comparisons within each filename

within_dimension_variability.csv - Variability statistics for descriptions within each dimension type


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
